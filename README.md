This is an arduinio flight controller designed for use with a kids foam plane from K-Mart to turn it into an RC plane.

Hundreds of people have done this far better - but this is just for personal fun.

All parts are generic stuff from AliExpress.

h1. Wiring Diagram

All wiring via nasty thin 28AWG wire except for those from the batteries to the ESC. Everything that needs a regulated 5v gets it from the arduino board (ground too), and mor edupont connectors that is resonable.
